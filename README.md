# Reinforcement Learning with DQN and SARSA on LunarLander-v2
This repository contains Python code for training reinforcement learning agents using Deep Q-Network (DQN) and State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) algorithms on the LunarLander-v2 environment from OpenAI's Gym.

## Usage
<ol>
  <li>Dependencies:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using: pip install gym numpy tensorflow rl</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Run the Code:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Execute the main script train_rl_agent.py to train agents with various configurations.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>Configuration:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Hyperparameters and training configurations can be adjusted in the script, including the number of hidden layers, nodes, learning rate, and more.</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Results:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>After training, the script prints the mean rewards achieved by the agents over a set of evaluation episodes.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
